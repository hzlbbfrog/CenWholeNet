Zhili He, Shang Jiang, Jian Zhang and Gang Wu. Our paper is available.

The codes will be available after the paper is accepted.

# Usage
1. Requirements

2. Clone the repo
~~~
git clone https://github.com/hzlbbfrog/CenWholeNet.git

Or, you can "Download ZIP".

3. Train and test your own data set

# CenterNet
The official [repo](https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet/) was not adopted because of some reasons.
A [simple pytorch implementation version](https://github.com/zzzxxxttt/pytorch_simple_CenterNet_45) was used, which is **simpler and easier** to read.
What's more, a detailed compilation process is introduced in that repo. O(∩_∩)O
If you want to use CenterNet quickly, **try it**!

# About Faster R-CNN 
Faster R-CNN was compared in our paper.
You can access this [repo](https://github.com/potterhsu/easy-faster-rcnn.pytorch) to get the corresponding codes.
To tell the truth, it may be a little complicated to compile Faster R-CNN in Win 10. (facepalm)

# About YOLOv5
YOLOv5 was also compared in our paper.
You can access this [repo](https://https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) to get the corresponding codes.
